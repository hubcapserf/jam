**Jam** was created by hubcapserf, with a love for terminal tools and musical flow.

### Inspired by:
- [MOC (Music on Console)](https://moc.daper.net/)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) â€” for fast fuzzy file selection
- Shell scripting weirdness and the lo-fi charm of Zsh

_Special thanks to the open-source community and anyone who keeps their shell sounding great._
